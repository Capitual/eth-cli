0xtransactionID
```

Library Help
------------

This project also exposes a Javascript class, which you can use in your NodeJS or browser projects. It can be included on NodeJS using require:

```javascript
const EthereumWallet = require('ethereum-cli')
```

On browsers, you can include it using `<script>`, and the global class `EthereumWallet` will be available.

```html
<script src="./node_modules/ethereum-cli/lib/index.js"></script>
```
### Initializing

You must instantiate the class and initialize it.

```javascript
let myWallet = new EthereumWallet() // using MyEtherAPI.com web3 HTTP provider
```

The class constructor may receive an optional argument, setting a web3 server to connect to. By default, MyEtherAPI.com provider is used, however it has great limitations as it is intended for testing purposes only. **It is highly recommended to set your own web3 provider.** You may want to set up a [web3 provider on AWS using Docker](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/docker-geth-lb) (note that it will cost you real money), or signup and use [Infura](https://infura.io) services.

```javascript
let myWallet = new EthereumWallet('https://mainnet.infura.io/<your infura key>') // using Infura provider

let myWallet = new EthereumWallet('https://localhost:8456') // using your local provider
```

You can modify the provider at any time using `myWallet.setProvider(<provider>)`.

In order to initialize the wallet, call:

```javascript
myWallet.init()
```

It may receive an optional argument which is a folder where to keep the wallet data. By default, it is "~/.ethereum-cli". You can change it so:

```javascript
myWallet.init("/path/to/data/dir")
```

In order to check if your provider is still syncing, just check the boolean getter `myWallet.isSyncing`.

### Creating wallet

If your wallet hasn't been created yet, it's needed to create it.

It's easy to check if your wallet has been created. Just check for the existence of a keystore.

```javascript
if (await myWallet.hasKeystore) {
	// wallet exists
} else {
	// wallet does not exist
}
```

In order to create a wallet, you need a seed. Generate one so:

```javascript
let seed = myWallet.generateSeed()
```

Save the seed safely, then create the keystore:

```javascript
let password = 'your-wallet-password' // choose one
await myWallet.createKeystore(password, seed)
```

### Unlocking your wallet

If you are going to perform any action that requires password (i.e. sending funds, signing transactions, generating wallets), unlock your wallet so:

```javascript
myWallet.unlock('your-wallet-password')
```

In order to check if your wallet is unlocked, just check if `myWallet.isUnlocked` is true.

### Generating addresses

It is needed to generate an address. To do so, just call:

```javascript
let address = myWallet.getNewAddress()
```

It will return the new address as a string.

In order to generate multiple addresses, specify the amount of addresses to generate:

```javascript
let addresses = myWallet.getNewAddress(5)
```

It will return an array with the addresses.

If needed, you can get an address' private key with:

```javascript
let privKey = myWallet.dumpPrivKey('address')
```

Or even convert a private key back to address:

```javascript
let walletAddress = myWallet.privKeyToAddress(privKey)
```

An array of ever generated addresses is always available at:

```javascript
let myAddresses = myWallet.addresses
```

### Getting your balance

Your balance summed up (from all your wallets) can be obtained, in weis, through:

```javascript
let balance = await myWallet.balance
```

Whereas the balance of an specified address is found with:

```javascript
let balance = await myWallet.getBalance('address')
```

It can receive an optional argument, with the number of confirmations needed for a balance to be summed up (default is 1).

```javascript
let balanceWith3Confs = await myWallet.getBalance('address', 3)
```

### Blocks and Transactions

You can get the current block number with:

```javascript
let blockCount = await myWallet.blockNumber
```

Information about a block is got with:

```javascript
let blockInfo = await myWallet.getBlock(block_id_or_hash)
```

Information about a specified transaction is available by:

```javascript
let txInfo = await myWallet.getTransaction('txid')
```

### Gas

You can get the current gas price (median of the latest blocks).

```javascript
let gasPrice = await myWallet.gasPrice
```

And estimate the gas needed for a transaction:

```javascript
let gasLimit = await myWallet.estimateGas({
	value: 'tx amount',
	to: 'target wallet',
	gasPrice: await myWallet.gasPrice,
	nonce: myWallet.getNonce(fromWallet),
	data: 'optional'
})
```

### Transaction

Sending Ether is as easy as:

```javascript
let from_wallet = 'from_wallet' // your origin wallet or myWallet.addresses[0]
let to_wallet = 'destination'
let amount = 1*10e18 // in Wei (1*10^18 Wei = 1 Ether)

try {
	let txid = await myWallet.sendToAddress(from_wallet, to_wallet, amount)
} catch(e) {
	console.log("Could not send Ether. Reason: "+e.message)
}
```

The `.sendToAddress` method can also receive two additional arguments, `gasPrice` and `gasLimit` respectively, which, by default, are automaticaly calculated. If you want to skip `gasPrice` but set `gasLimit`, then set `gasPrice` as `undefined`.

#### Raw Transactions

You can create a hex-encoded raw transaction, instead of sending it directly. The usage of this method is the very same as `.sendToAddress()` and it returns your hex-encoded transaction as string.

```javascript
let hexTx = await myWallet.createRawTx(from_wallet, to_wallet, amount)
```

Before sending your raw transaction, it is needed to sign it:

```javascript
let signedHexTx = myWallet.signTx(hexTx, from)
```

Finally, push it:

```javascript
try {
	let txid = await myWallet.sendRawTx(signedHexTx)
} catch(e) {
	console.log("Could not push tx. Reason: "+e.message)
}

### Backup & Restore

You can get back your seed with:

```javascript
let seed = myWallet.seed
```

It is not possible to recover your password (therefore, do not lose it). You can only get your seed after unlocking (`myWallet.unlock(password)`) your wallet with your password.

In order to restore your wallet, set the seed with `createKeystore`. You can specify a new password if you want.

```javascript
let password = 'your-wallet-password' // choose one or use the previous one
await myWallet.createKeystore(password, 'your seed')
```
